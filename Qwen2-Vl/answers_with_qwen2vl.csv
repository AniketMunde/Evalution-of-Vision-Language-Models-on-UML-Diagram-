How does encapsulation improve the security of this system through the use of private classes?

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves bundling data and methods into a single unit, known as an object. This helps in controlling access to the object's internal data and methods, making it more secure and easier to manage.

In the context of the provided class diagram, encapsulation can be improved by ensuring that the internal data of each class is protected and can only be accessed through public methods. This means that the private variables of each class should not be directly accessible from outside the class.
