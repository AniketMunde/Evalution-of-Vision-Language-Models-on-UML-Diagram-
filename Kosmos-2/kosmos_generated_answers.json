This can lead to inconsistencies in the data, which could affect the overall performance of the application. Secondly, it may make it difficult for other classes to access or modify the data in the Opportunity class. This could lead to a loss of functionality or data integrity. Lastly, it could also lead to the creation of a new class, which may not be compatible with other classes or data structures.",
            "How does encapsulation improve the security of this system through the use of private classes? Encapsulating private classes in the system allows for better security by providing a separation between the data and the code. This separation allows for the code to be more secure, as it is not exposed to the outside world. Encapsuled classes also provide a more controlled environment for the data, as they are not exposed directly to the user. This can help prevent accidental changes or modifications to the data. Additionally, encapsuling private classes can help reduce the number of vulnerabilities in the code, as the code is not directly exposed to external users. This is particularly important in systems that are highly dependent on external users, such as databases or web applications."
